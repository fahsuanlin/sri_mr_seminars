Abstract: 
CNS tuberculosis is one of the most devastating and severe forms of tuberculosis (TB) accounting for 5-10% of extrapulmonary TB , with high morbidity and mortality in 50% of patients. In resource limited countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the widespread availability of cross sectional imaging can be a challenge. Al improvement in the techniques of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in neuroradiology has primarily focused on neuro-oncology, stroke imaging and hemorrhage. This talk will focus on the question of exploring the role of Al in neuroimaging in low and middle income countries (MIC) and how well it will fare in the setting of images obtained from the low-field magnets at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital. Specifically, the performance of promising ML and DL methods for detecting and characterizing CNS TB lesions will be discussed.

Abstract:
The use of multiple transmission channels, referred to as parallel radio-frequency transmission (pTx), offers numerous advantages across various applications. These benefits include enhanced B1-field homogeneity, spatially selective excitation, decreased global specific absorption rate (SAR), and minimized artifacts related to implants and implant coupling. In this presentation, I will be focusing on the capabilities of pTx, with a primary emphasis on its safe mode application in the presence of brain implants.

##  Embracing beats and breaths: MR Multitasking for motion-resolved quantitative cardiac imaging
### **Anthony Christodoulou (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center)**
### July 12, 2023 

![](https://github.com/fahsuanlin/sri_mr_seminars/blob/main/images/20230712_anthonychristodoulou.jpg)

Abstract: 
Quantitative MRI provides many benefits over traditional qualitative imaging: reproducible tissue characterization, diagnosis of diffuse disease, the potential for earlier disease detection, and more. The standard approach to quantitative MRI of moving organs (e.g., the heart or abdominal organs) has been to “freeze” motion using a complicated mixture of ECG triggering and repeated breath holds. That approach is difficult, unreliable, and most importantly, unsuitable for patients with irregular heartbeats or trouble breath-holding, preventing the wide clinical adoption of quantitative MR in many areas. This seminar describes a new class of approaches to quantitative imaging, which redesign the MR imaging process around the concept of multiple time dimensions. Rather than trying to avoid motion, these approaches “multitask”, capturing motion alongside multiple simultaneous tissue processes for quantification—each of which is assigned its own time dimension. This allows fast, accurate, and repeatable motion-resolved quantitative imaging, and enables non-ECG, free-breathing quantification of multiple tissue parameters at once.

## Robust, high-fidelity image reconstruction from noisy, sub-sampled training data with self-supervised learning
### **Charles Millard (University of Oxford)**
### June 14, 2023 

![](https://github.com/fahsuanlin/sri_mr_seminars/blob/main/images/20230614_CharlesMillard.JPG)

Abstract: 
MRI's temporal resolution is hindered by an inherently slow data acquisition process. To address this, there has been substantial research attention on methods that aim to reconstruct high quality images from sub-sampled, accelerated acquisitions. In recent years, reconstructing sub-sampled acquisitions with neural networks has emerged as the state of the art. Most such methods assume that a fully sampled, high SNR dataset exists and use fully-supervised training, however, such training data may not be readily available and can be difficult or even infeasible to acquire in practice. In this talk, Charles will discuss self-supervised training methods, where the training data is itself sub-sampled. He will present his recent work which analytically justifies one such method, Self-Supervised Learning via Data Undersampling (SSDU), and proposes modifications and extensions that substantially improve its reconstruction quality and robustness to measurement noise and training hyperparameters.

Bio:
Dr. Charles Millard is a post-doctoral researcher working in the magnetic resonance physics group at the Wellcome Centre For Integrative Neuroimaging, University of Oxford. His work focuses on methods for image reconstruction from sub-sampled acquisitions with compressed sensing and deep learning. Currently, he is developing self-supervised methods, where a neural network is trained to reconstruct images from sub-sampled examples only. Charles completed his doctorate at the University of Oxford in 2022.


## Advantages of Hybrid PET-MR in clinical research: dynamic PET (dPET) 
### **Adam Farag (Toronto General Hospital)**
### May 24, 2023 

![](https://github.com/fahsuanlin/sri_mr_seminars/blob/main/images/20230524_adamfarag.png)

Abstract: 
Dynamic Positron Emission Tomography (dPET) is a known approach used with 18F-FDG in characterizing tumors. Nevertheless, the development of new radiopharmaceutical tracers has widened the use of dPET to other clinical applications, such as hypoxia. Indeed, a radiopharmaceutical tracer, such as 18F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside (18F-FAZA) appears to be suitable for studying hypoxia using dPET to distinguish between hypoxic and normal tissues. Here, we explore the first attempt to use this approach in Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).

Bio:
Adam started his career in medical imaging in 2008. He collaborated with Robarts Research Institute scientists in achieving the first human 129-Xe Hyperpolarized lung imaging in Canada, paving the way to a better understanding of lung functions, and in particular, COPD diseases. Shortly after, he developed the technique and tools to measure the tissue sodium concentration in prostate which can be correlated to cancer stages, as a part of a multiparametric study.  
When the first PET/MRI scanner came to Canada, he spearheaded, in collaboration with a team of scientists at Lawson Research Institute, the development of the world’s first transparent-to-PET, high-density radiofrequency resonators, particularly for brain imaging. Thereafter, at Western University he furthered his research to improve hybrid PET/MRI cardiovascular imaging by improving the attenuation correction coefficient.  
Now as a scientist at UHN, he is collaborating with fellow scientists and doctors, in different studies to understand hypoxia through kinetic modelling of the PET uptake. Furthermore, he is collaborating with the PET/MR vendor to improve PET quantification accuracy, by investigating motion / attenuation correction and methods of PET reconstruction techniques

## Quantification of Fetal Cardiovascular Physiology Using MRI
### **Chris Macgowan (Sickkids)**
### April 12, 2023 

![](https://github.com/fahsuanlin/sri_mr_seminars/blob/main/images/20230412_chrismacgowan.png)

Abstract: 
Normal fetal development relies on a healthy supply of oxygenated blood. This supply can be disrupted by a variety of conditions including fetal congenital heart disease, placental dysfunction, and fetal anemia. The consequences of inadequate supply range from fetal demise to the injury of critical organs such as the brain, heart and lungs. To better understand fetal cardiovascular physiology in healthy and at-risk pregnancies, we have developed MRI methods to quantify fetal cardiac anatomy, blood flow, blood oxygenation and hematocrit. This information may one-day guide the timing of traditional therapies, such as early delivery, and allow monitoring of emerging therapies that modify the fetal circulation such as maternal oxygen supplementation and surgical correction of fetal cardiovascular anatomy. In this presentation, I will provide a technical overview of fetal cardiovascular MRI and demonstrate application of MRI to animal and human studies of fetal cardiovascular physiology.

Bio: 
Chris Macgowan obtained his BSc in physics from the University of British Columbia (1993) and his MSc & PhD in medical biophysics from the University of Toronto (1996 & 2000).

## Cutting-edge technologies for Spinal Cord MRI
### **Julian Cohen-Adad (Polytechnique Montreal)**
### December 7, 2022 

![](https://github.com/fahsuanlin/sri_mr_seminars/blob/main/images/cohenadad_pic.png)

Abstract:
Neuroimaging MRI biomarkers include volumetric measures, microstructure imaging such as diffusion-weighted imaging and magnetization transfer, and functional MRI. These biomarkers nicely complement clinical indices and provide objective means to monitor disease evolution in patients. While being very popular in the brain, MRI biomarkers have been slow to translate to the spinal cord because of technical challenges: (i) The need for high resolution and the difficulties in harnessing 7T systems, (ii) Susceptibility artifacts and shimming, (iii) The lack of standardized imaging protocol across vendors and (iv) Unmet needs for analyzing spinal cord MRI data. This talk will be organized around these challenges, by proposing cutting-edge solutions and discussing their pros and cons.

## Real-time 4D MRI for video-guided adaptive radiotherapy
### **Ricardo Otazo (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center)		**
### October 26, 2022 

![](https://github.com/fahsuanlin/sri_mr_seminars/blob/main/images/20221026_ricardootazo.jpg)

Abstract: The combination of a MRI scanner with a linear accelerator (linac), known as MR-linac, enables to use MRI to guide radiotherapy on each fraction of the process. The MR-linac has the potential to adapt the delivery of radiation for tumors affected by motion in real-time. However, the slow speed of conventional MRI only enables to perform real-time MRI in 2D, which limits the performance for motion tracking. This talk presents a new approach for real-time 4D MRI called MR SIGnature MAtching (MRSIGMA), which shifts the acquisition and reconstruction burden to an offline learning step to compute a 4D dictionary of 3D motion states and motion signatures that identify each state in a unique way, and an online signature matching step that is able to perform 3D imaging with a total latency of less than 300 ms (including acquisition and reconstruction). The concept of MRSIGMA, real-time implementation on the Elekta Unity MR-linac system and initial validation on patients with pancreatic cancer will be presented.

Bio: Ricardo Otazo is currently the Director of MRI Physics and Member in Physics and Radiology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. He received his PhD in Engineering from the University of New Mexico in 2007 and was a faculty member in the Department of Radiology at NYU Langone Health before moving to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in 2018. Dr. Otazo is a world leader in the development of fast and motion-tolerant MRI techniques using compressed sensing, deep learning and non-cartesian sampling. He is one of the pioneers in the application of compressed sensing for accelerated MRI acquisition and the combination of compressed sensing and non-cartesian acquisition for motion-tolerant body MRI. His more recent interests are the development of artificial intelligence techniques for high-performance MRI and the development of real-time 3D MRI techniques for online adaptive radiotherapy of organs affected by motion using a MR-linac system.

## Beyond B0 shimming: Emerging applications of local magnetic field control
### **Jason Stockmann (Massachusetts General Hospital)**
### May 25, 2022 
![]https://github.com/fahsuanlin/sri_mr_seminars/blob/main/images/20220525_jasonstockmann.png)

I will describe a new generation of massively-parallel array coils aimed at improving human MR neuroimaging well as simultaneous imaging and neuromodulation.  An overarching goal is to push the limits of MRI resolution and speed, particularly for functional and diffusion MR imaging, enabling non-invasive studies of brain structure and function at finer spatial scales.  Specifically, I will discuss the synergistic combination of high-channel count radiofrequency (RF) receive arrays with “B0” shim arrays for accelerating image acquisition while reducing image artifacts (particularly at 7 Tesla and beyond).  In addition to new array coils for neuroimaging, we are also developing multi-channel, MR-compatible transcranial magnetic simulation (TMS) coils that allow the electric field to be dynamically steered and reoriented over the cortical surface.  This provides new degrees of freedom for probing the activity of multiple brain circuits either simultaneously or sequentially.  Bringing together two types of array coils, we are integrating a 48-ch TMS array with a 28-ch RF receive array to provide unprecedented image quality for simultaneous TMS-fMRI experiments.   Exploiting these hardware capabilities further, we have begun exploring the use of the current-carrying loops in our TMS coils for MRI applications such as diffusion encoding and B0 shimming. The unifying theme of these hardware subsystems is “local field control” using the many degrees of freedom provided by large arrays to dynamically shape both the B-field and E-field for imaging and neuromodulation, thus extending the utility of MRI and TMS for systems neuroscience.

Jason Stockmann, PhD, is broadly interested in magnetic resonance imaging hardware and acquisition methods for improving data quality for both structural and functional imaging. He has worked on diverse MRI scanners ranging in field strength by two orders of magnitude, from low-field (70 mT) to ultra-high field (7 Tesla). He specializes in synergistic combinations of hardware, pulse sequences, and image reconstruction algorithms that address unmet needs in MRI research, especially for diffusion and functional brain imaging with echo planar imaging (EPI) acquisitions. The major thrust of this work has been to develop multi-coil (MC) shim arrays and associated amplifier hardware and optimization methods to improve magnetic field homogeneity inside the body, thus reducing image distortions and other artifacts. More recently, he and colleagues have applied MC arrays to perform dynamic local field control, creating tailored nonlinear field offsets for (i) improving lipid suppression in spectroscopy, (ii) selectively exciting and imaging target anatomy with increased efficiency, and (iii) providing supplementary spatial encoding.  
Dr. Stockmann is also interested in low-field, portable MRI for point-of-care brain imaging. He has contributed to Dr. Lawrence Wald and Dr. Clarissa Cooley’s program to build a lightweight prototype brain scanner based on a Halbach array of permanent magnets (80mT main magnetic field). His primary role in this project has been to design pulse sequences and RF pulses that are robust to extreme field inhomogeneity. He has also helped build a generalized reconstruction framework that incorporates the full signal forward model including field nonlinearity. In parallel with this work, he has developed an interest in open-source hardware for MRI research and education. To this end, he contributed to a team effort by Dr. Wald’s group to build 20 tabletop MRI scanners (0.2 Tesla) for an undergraduate engineering lab course at MIT, at a cost of less than $10K per scanner.
He is strongly committed to open-source science and reproducible research across sites. All of his hardware designs and software are available online or by request.

## Encoding field measurement for MRI: Technology basis and application outlook

### **Paul Weavers (Skope Inc.)**
### April 13, 2022 

![](https://github.com/fahsuanlin/sri_mr_seminars/blob/main/images/20220413_paulweavers.png)

Magnetic Resonance Imaging offers an enormously flexible tool to answer questions about the human body. The MR scanner itself is a complex device, but knowledge of encoding fields and the deviations from nominal scanner behavior can reduce measurement uncertainty. These measurements and system characterizations can then be used to compensate for deviations in the image acquisition, whether from systematic or physiologic origin. Additionally, the measurement of these field dynamics can enable new implementations of image acquisition techniques which were previously subject to unacceptable levels of distortion or signal loss.

Dr. Weavers completed his PhD in 2014 at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, MN where he focused on patient-specific optimizations of parallel imaging parameters as enabled by high performance computing and receiver coil design.  From there he spent two and a half years as a post-doc with Dr. Matt Bernstein on the final system design and application of a prototype head-only 3T MRI system.  Here Paul contributed to general image quality improvements through implementing field corrections through real-time processing on scanner FPGAs.  From there a stint at GE Healthcare in the MR Engineering department taught Paul quite a lot about the realities around MR system design and productization.

Paul joined Skope in 2018, and now leads the global sales, marketing and North American support teams.  He focuses quite heavily on ensuring the technical capabilities of a field monitoring system are crystal clear to potential users, and that once the system is delivered it is useful to the researcher.

## “Combined diffusion-relaxometry techniques” and “Improving the sensitivity and specificity of functional magnetic resonance imaging”
 
### **Dr. Colleen Bailey and Dr. Hsin-Ju Lee (Sunnybrook Research Institute)**
### March 23, 2022

### Dr. Colleen Bailey
Colleen Bailey is an MR physicist working on MRI methods for cancer therapy response. She uses biophysical models to explore the relationship of cellular changes with diffusion and relaxation MRI. These have revealed changes in cellularity and membrane water exchange resulting from cell death following cancer treatment.
### Combined diffusion-relaxometry techniques
Limitations in diffusion MRI, along with new acquisition and reconstruction techniques, have led to renewed interest in combined diffusion-relaxation MRI protocols in the diffusion community. I will present a summary of this history and a recent review paper (doi: 10.1002/mrm.28963), considering what 2D diffusion-relaxation methods can and cannot tell us. The lessons learned are likely to be of broader interest beyond MRI diffusion and get to questions about research studying biological mechanisms versus clinical applications.Speaker 2: 

### Dr. Hsin-Ju Lee
With the training in cognitive neuroscience and human neuroimaging, Dr. Hsin-Ju Lee is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Sunnybrook Research Institute. Hsin-Ju has been focusing on developing and applying neuroimaging tools and psychological tasks to better understand brain functions and dysfunction. Her research projects use the integration of fMRI, EEG, and TMS to study the neural mechanisms supporting executive controls. She also applies these methods to improve the medical and surgical treatments for schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactive and epilepsy patients.Presentation Title: Improving the sensitivity and specificity of functional magnetic resonance imaging
### Improving the sensitivity and specificity of functional magnetic resonance imaging
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used extensively to suggest "active brain areas" in healthy individuals' cognitive processes, emotional states, and perception. This technique has also been applied to help diagnose, assess, and manage neurological and psychiatric disorders. While fMRI benefits from non-invasiveness and relatively high spatial resolution (about 1 mm) for whole-brain imaging, it has limitations in sensitivity and specificity. In this talk, I will present methods to mitigate these fMRI challenges. Specifically, an emerging trend of using complex naturalistic stimuli will be introduced to probe the brain function and dysfunction more sensitively in an ecologically valid setting. Then, I will explain how incorporating electrophysiological measurements, including concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) recording with fMRI and invasive stereo-EEG, discloses fMRI signals closely related to typical and abnormal neural activity. Lastly, I will introduce the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to elucidate causal relationships between brain activity and behaviors. Together, advancements in the experimental paradigm design, multimodal imaging, and the integration of imaging and modulation improve the sensitivity and specificity of fMRI in neuroscience studies and clinical applications.
